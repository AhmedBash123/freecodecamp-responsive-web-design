# freeCodeCamp – Responsive Web Design Projects

## 🌱 My Learning Journey

I'm progressing through the **freeCodeCamp** Front-End path.  
I’ve now **completed all HTML modules** — including **Basic HTML**, **Semantic HTML**, **Forms & Tables**, and **Accessibility** — and I’m officially done with the **HTML part (100%)**! 🎉  

Next, I’ll move on to **CSS**, then **JavaScript**, followed by **React.js** to strengthen my Front-End development skills.  
After that, I’ll start learning **Back-End Development** to handle databases, APIs, and servers — continuing my journey to become a **complete Software Engineer**.

### 🧠 What I Gained from HTML

Finishing the HTML section gave me a solid foundation and understanding of how the web is structured.  
Here’s what I learned and improved:

- 🧩 How to build well-structured, semantic pages using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
- 🦾 Accessibility best practices using `aria-labels`, `alt` text, and proper form elements.  
- 🎛 Creating responsive tables, forms, and multimedia elements (like video/audio players).  
- 💡 The importance of readability, structure, and semantic meaning in web design.  
- 🚀 Confidence to build complete web pages from scratch!

HTML taught me that **structure is everything** — it’s the foundation of every modern website.
